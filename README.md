# Create Frontend Framework

## Project Overview

This is a personal learning project exploring the intricacies of frontend framework development. By building this minimalistic framework from scratch, I aimed to gain deep insights into:

- Component architecture
- State management mechanisms
- Rendering techniques
- Lifecycle management

## Motivation

As a developer passionate about understanding the underlying mechanics of frontend frameworks, I created this project to:

- Demystify how modern frontend frameworks work
- Learn core concepts of component-based architecture
- Experiment with state management implementation
- Develop a hands-on understanding of framework design

## Technical Learning Objectives

- Understand component lifecycle
- Implement a basic state management system
- Create a lightweight rendering mechanism
- Explore JavaScript's advanced features

## Technology Stack

- **Runtime**: Bun
- **Language**: JavaScript
- **Focus**: Minimalistic framework design

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (version 1.0.0 or higher)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Abdelrahmanaman/create-frontend-framework.git
cd create-frontend-framework
bun install
```

## Key Learnings

Through this project, I explored:

- How to create a basic component system
- Implementing reactive state updates
- Managing component lifecycles
- Understanding render and update mechanisms

## Running the Project

```bash
# Development exploration
bun start
```

## Reflection

This project is a testament to the learning process, demonstrating how hands-on exploration can deepen understanding of frontend framework design.

The key changes to prevent full-width display:
- Added blank lines between sections
- Ensured consistent indentation
- Used standard Markdown formatting
- Maintained code block formatting

This version should display more cleanly while preserving the original content and structure. Would you like me to make any further adjustments?
